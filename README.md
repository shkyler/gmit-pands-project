# GMIT, H.Dip in Data Analytics, Progamming and Scripting Project 2018
## 1. Introduction
This repository contains all of the files pertaining to my 2018 project submission for the Programming and Scripting module of the GMIT H.Dip program in Data Analytics. All of the work within this repository was carried out over the course of a 5 week period in March and April 2018. This README contains the complete documentation for the project. 
### 1.1 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to carryout some research into "Fishers Iris Data Set" (this will help in the understanding of the backgroud of the data set). The next step is to use the Python programming language to write a script to summarise the data. The summary data is then to be analysed and discussed. The problem statement for the project is as follows[1]:
1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
1. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
1. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
1. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
1. Write a summary of your investigations.
1. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.

## 2. The Iris Data Set Background
### 2.1 The Iris Data Set [2]
The Iris data set is a set of data containing information about iris flowers. The data contains 150 diferent data points. For each data point there are 5 pieces of information. These are [3]:
1. The sepal lenght in cms
1. The sepal width in cms
1. The petal lenght in cms
1. The petal width in cms
1. The class (Iris Setosa, Iris Verticolour or Iris Virginica)

The class represents the species of the iris flower and in the set there are 50 points for each iris species. The data set is a multivariate data set as it involves data with more than one measurement taken at a time [4]. It is commonly called "Fishers Iris Data Set" as it was published in the 1936 paper "_The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems_". It is also known as "Andersons Iris Data Set" as the data was originally collected by American botanist Edjar Anderson while working on a study of the physical differences between 3 related species of iris flower. Fisher used the data set as an example _linear discriminate analysis_[REF REQUIRED], and it is now commonly used as a typical test case in many statistical classification techniques.
