# GMIT, H.Dip in Data Analytics, Progamming and Scripting Project 2018
## Introduction
This repository contains all of he files pertaining to my 2018 project submission for the Programming and Scripting module of the GMIT H.Dip program in Data Analytics. All of the work within was carried out over the course of a 5 week period in March and April 2018. This README contains the complete documentation for the project. 
### Project Objective
The objective of this project is to carryout some research into "Fishers Iris Data Set" (this will help in the understanding of the backgroud of the data set). The next step is to use the Python programming language to write a script to summarise the data. The summary data is then to be analysed and discussed. The problem statement for the project is as follows:
1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
1. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
1. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
1. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
1. Write a summary of your investigations.
1. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.
## The Iris Data Set Background
### The Data Set
### Fisher and Anderson
### The Principles of LDA (very basic laymans terms)
### Popularity of the Iris set in Teaching and Study

## My Code
### What it does
### How to use it
### Results obtained from the analysis with some graphics if possible
### Discussion of the results
